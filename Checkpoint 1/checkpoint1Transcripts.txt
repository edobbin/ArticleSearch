You can use the details provided in the uploaded documents to fill out the BUC Template for each relevant business event. Here's how you can map the details:

Article Search Process
Business Event Name:
Academic initiates the article search process.

Business Use Case Name:
Article Search Process.

Trigger:
The academic identifies a broad research objective or question.

Pre-Conditions:
Academic has a defined research objective/question.
Access to a research database like Google Scholar or university library links.
Interested Stakeholders:
Academic.
University library staff (indirectly involved when linking unavailable articles).
Active Stakeholders:
Academic.
Normal Case Steps:
Define relevant keywords based on the research objective.
Perform a search on Google Scholar or a similar research repository.
Review results (title and abstract) to identify relevant articles.
Download articles if available; otherwise, check availability through university library links.
Save unavailable article citations in a document.
Refine keywords if the first set yields insufficient results.
Repeat until at least 20 articles are identified for a preliminary review.
Alternate Case Steps:
Articles are unavailable in the initial repository but located via the library's external links.
Conduct additional searches using new or refined keywords.
Exception Case Steps:
Unable to find relevant articles due to overly broad or niche topics.
Outcome:
A collection of at least 20 relevant articles for the literature review.

Article Analysis Process
Business Event Name:
Academic initiates the article analysis process.

Business Use Case Name:
Article Analysis Process.

Trigger:
Academic has sufficient articles for analysis.

Pre-Conditions:
At least 20 relevant articles downloaded.
Access to a spreadsheet application for analysis.
Interested Stakeholders:
Academic.
Research collaborator.
Active Stakeholders:
Academic.
Normal Case Steps:
Scan downloaded articles to extract and document relevant details.
Populate the spreadsheet with data for each article, including:
Title, publication source, authors, date, research question, methodology, outcomes, comments.
Review and finalize the spreadsheet for relevance.
Share the spreadsheet with the research collaborator for further discussion.
Alternate Case Steps:
Additional relevant articles are added during analysis and documented similarly.
Exception Case Steps:
Irrelevant or low-quality articles are excluded from the review.
Outcome:
A detailed, organized spreadsheet summarizing the literature review, shared with collaborators for project discussions.

You can use this structure in your BUC Scenarios document and update it as needed to reflect any specifics you may want to emphasize. Let me know if you'd like help refining or expanding any section!

Your document is shaping up well, and it captures the key components of the Business Use Case (BUC) scenarios effectively. Here are some suggestions to refine it further:

General Feedback:
Clarity of Steps:

In the "Normal Case Steps," break down actions more clearly into individual points for better readability. For example, instead of combining steps like "Scan the results (look at the title and then the abstract to see if they are relevant)," split it into:
Scan the results.
Review the title and abstract of each article for relevance.
Outcome Section:

The "Outcome" sections are currently blank. These should describe what happens when the process is completed successfully. For example:
Article Search Process: "A set of at least 20 relevant articles is identified and ready for the next phase of analysis."
Article Analysis Process: "A detailed spreadsheet summarizing key article information is created and shared with collaborators for project discussions."
Consistency in Language:

Use consistent terms like "researcher" or "academic" throughout for clarity. Avoid switching between them unless necessary for context.
Alternate Case Steps:

Add more specificity. For instance, in "Collaborator input during analysis to help with data entry/filtering," elaborate on what kind of input or filtering might be expected.
Exception Case Steps:

Ensure these describe rare but possible situations that might disrupt the normal flow. For example:
"If no relevant articles are found in initial searches, consult with collaborators to redefine search keywords."
Suggestions for Specific Sections:
Article Search Process
Pre-Conditions: Include a bullet point specifying that the academic has access to tools for saving or citing articles.
Interested Stakeholders: Refine "The Academic, and the Research Database/library(s) they choose" to "The academic and administrators of the chosen research databases or library systems."
Article Analysis Process
Pre-Conditions: Add that the academic has access to spreadsheet tools or software for organizing data.
Active Stakeholders: You might want to clarify how the collaborator actively participates (e.g., reviewing the analysis, offering feedback).
LLM Acknowledgment:
Your LLM acknowledgment is clear and meets typical requirements. Just ensure the transcript is attached in the required format when submitting.

Would you like me to help fill out the "Outcome" sections or adjust other parts of the document?
