The document outlines a process for conducting a literature review, split into two key processes: Article Search and Article Analysis. Based on the steps described, here are potential alternate case steps and exception case steps:
Article Search Process
Alternate Case Steps
Use of alternate research repositories: If Google Scholar does not provide enough results, the user might turn to other databases like PubMed, IEEE Xplore, or JSTOR.
Adjusting keywords: After scanning the first batch of articles, the user refines the keyword search to include synonyms or more specific terms to narrow or broaden the search.
Expanding the search scope: If not enough relevant articles are found within the first two pages of results, the user may consider looking at additional pages or trying another research database.
Exception Case Steps
Unavailability of articles:
The article is not downloadable directly: The user uses the library's link to check for access through Towson University or other sources.
If access remains unavailable: The user notes the citation details for later retrieval.
Low relevance of results: If most results are irrelevant, the user rethinks the search strategy, possibly redefining the research question or goals.
Technical difficulties: If access to Google Scholar or the library database is interrupted, the process is paused until access is restored or another repository is used.
